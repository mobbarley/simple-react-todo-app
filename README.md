# simple-react-todo-list
A small basic todo list using React. 

Created from -- [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) [React Tutorial]() and some small changes have been applied to keep it a bit modernish with some small cosmetic changes.  

Original Github repo is [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/react-playlist), but this one is not a direct fork of it but a rewrite.

To use please do the following steps:

1. Clone git repo.
2. cd into directory.
3. Run 'npm start'
4. App is running on localhost:1234. In case the PORT needs to be changed it can be done inside the webpack launch setting inside the build script in package.json
